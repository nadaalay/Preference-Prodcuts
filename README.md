## Preference Products

## Project Motivation
Customers are important to the survival and success of any business because they are the source of the revenue. The success of a business is the ability to satisfy customers and make them happy, and therefore turn a profit from them. Giving the customer recommendation about items that can buy it may attract them. Using retail transactional data can help in products recommendations. 

In this project, I will analyze an online retail transactional dataset to find the top preferences products, the preferences products for each active customers, the top preference products in each country and the top preference products in each month. So, I will answer the following questions:

1. What is the preference product for each active customer?
2. What is the top three preference products in each country?
3. What is the top three preference products in each month?

Answering these questions can help in identifying the customersâ€™ favorite products depending on the month and country.
